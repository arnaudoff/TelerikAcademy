Homework: Conditional Statements
================================

### Problem 1. Exchange If Greater
*	Write an if-statement that takes two double variables a and b and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one. As a result print the values a and b, separated by a space.

_Examples:_

| a    | b   | result  |
|------|-----|---------|
| 5    | 2   | 2 5     |
| 3    | 4   | 3 4     |
| 5.5  | 4.5 | 4.5 5.5 |

### Problem 2. Bonus Score
*	Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range `[1…9]` by the following rules:
	*	If the score is between `1` and `3`, the program multiplies it by `10`.
	*	If the score is between `4` and `6`, the program multiplies it by `100`.
	*	If the score is between `7` and `9`, the program multiplies it by `1000`.
	*	If the score is `0` or more than `9`, the program prints `“invalid score”`.

_Examples:_

| score | result        |
|-------|---------------|
| 2     | 20            |
| 4     | 400           |
| 9     | 9000          |
| -1    | invalid score |
| 10    | invalid score |

### Problem 3. Check for a Play Card
*	Classical play cards use the following signs to designate the card face: `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K and A. Write a program that enters a string and prints “yes” if it is a valid card sign or “no” otherwise. Examples:

| character | Valid card sign? |
|-----------|------------------|
| 5         | yes              |
| 1         | no               |
| Q         | yes              |
| q         | no               |
| P         | no               |
| 10        | yes              |
| 500       | no               |

### Problem 4. Multiplication Sign
*	Write a program that shows the sign (+, - or 0) of the product of three real numbers, without calculating it.
	*	Use a sequence of `if` operators.

_Examples:_

| a    | b    | c    | result |
|------|------|------|:------:|
| 5    | 2    | 2    | +      |
| -2   | -2   | 1    | +      |
| -2   | 4    | 3    | -      |
| 0    | -2.5 | 4    | 0      |
| -1   | -0.5 | -5.1 | -      |

### Problem 5. The Biggest of 3 Numbers
*	Write a program that finds the biggest of three numbers.

_Examples:_

| a    | b    | c    | biggest |
|------|------|------|:-------:|
| 5    | 2    | 2    | 5       |
| -2   | -2   | 1    | 1       |
| -2   | 4    | 3    | 4       |
| 0    | -2.5 | 5    | 5       |
| -0.1 | -0.5 | -1.1 | -0.1    |

### Problem 6. The Biggest of Five Numbers
*	Write a program that finds the biggest of five numbers by using only five if statements.

_Examples:_

| a    | b    | c    |  d |   e  | biggest |
|------|------|------|:--:|:----:|---------|
| 5    | 2    | 2    | 4  | 1    | 5       |
| -2   | -22  | 1    | 0  | 0    | 1       |
| -2   | 4    | 3    | 2  | 0    | 4       |
| 0    | -2.5 | 0    | 5  | 5    | 5       |
| -3   | -0.5 | -1.1 | -2 | -0.1 | -0.1    |

### Problem 7. Sort 3 Numbers with Nested Ifs
*	Write a program that enters 3 real numbers and prints them sorted in descending order.
	*	Use nested `if` statements.

_Note: Don’t use arrays and the built-in sorting functionality._

_Examples:_

| a    | b    | c    |     result     |
|------|------|------|----------------|
| 5    | 1    | 2    | 5 2 1          |
| -2   | -2   | 1    | 1 -2 -2        |
| -2   | 4    | 3    | 4 3 -2         |
| 0    | -2.5 | 5    | 5 0 -2.5       |
| -1.1 | -0.5 | -0.1 | -0.1 -0.5 -1.1 |
| 10   | 20   | 30   | 30 20 10       |
| 1    | 1    | 1    | 1 1 1          |

### Problem 8. Digit as Word
*	Write a program that asks for a digit (0-9), and depending on the input, shows the digit as a word (in English).
	*	Print `“not a digit”` in case of invalid input.
	*	Use a switch statement.

_Examples:_

| d    | result      |
|------|-------------|
| 2    | two         |
| 1    | one         |
| 0    | zero        |
| 5    | five        |
| -0.1 | not a digit |
| hi   | not a digit |
| 9    | nine        |
| 10   | not a digit |

### Problem 9. Play with Int, Double and String
*	Write a program that, depending on the user’s choice, inputs an `int`, `double` or `string` variable.
	*	If the variable is `int` or `double`, the program increases it by one.
	*	If the variable is a `string`, the program appends `*` at the end.
*	Print the result at the console. Use switch statement.

_Example 1:_

| program                | user  |
|------------------------|-------|
| Please choose a type:  |       |
| 1 --> int              |       |
| 2 --> double           | 3     |
| 3 --> string           |       |
|                        |       |
| Please enter a string: | hello |
|                        |       |
| hello*                 |       |

_Example 2:_

| program                | user |
|------------------------|------|
| Please choose a type:  |      |
| 1 --> int              |      |
| 2 --> double           | 2    |
| 3 --> string           |      |
|                        |      |
| Please enter a double: | 1.5  |
|                        |      |
| 2.5                    |      |

	
### Problem 10.* Beer Time
*	A beer time is after `1:00 PM` and before `3:00 AM`.
*	Write a program that enters a time in format “hh:mm tt” (an hour in range [01...12], a minute in range [00…59] and AM / PM designator) and prints `beer time` or `non-beer time` according to the definition above or `invalid time` if the time cannot be parsed.
_Note: You may need to learn how to parse dates and times._ 

_Examples:_

| time     | result        |
|----------|---------------|
| 1:00 PM  | beer time     |
| 4:30 PM  | beer time     |
| 10:57 PM | beer time     |
| 8:30 AM  | non-beer time |
| 02:59 AM | beer time     |
| 03:00 AM | non-beer time |
| 03:26 AM | non-beer time |

### Problem 11.* Number as Words
*	Write a program that converts a number in the range [0…999] to words, corresponding to the English pronunciation.

_Examples:_

| numbers | number as words               | 
|---------|-------------------------------|-
| 0       | Zero                          | 
| 9       | Nine                          |

| 98      | Ninety eight                  | 
| 273     | Two hundred and seventy three | 
| 400     | Four hundred                  | 
| 501     | Five hundred and one          | 
| 617     | Six hundred and seventeen     | 
| 711     | Seven hundred and eleven      | 
| 999     | Nine hundred and ninety nine  |

### Problem 12.* Zero Subset
*	We are given 5 integer numbers. Write a program that finds all subsets of these numbers whose sum is 0.
*	Assume that repeating the same subset several times is not a problem.

_Examples:_

| numbers       | result                |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| 3  -2  1  1 8 | -2 + 1 + 1 = 0        |
|               |                       |
| 3 1 -7 35 22  | no zero subset        |
|               |                       |
| 1 3 -4 -2 -1  | 1 + -1 = 0            |
|               | 1 + 3 + -4 = 0        |
|               | 3 + -2 + -1 = 0       |
|               |                       |
| 1 1 1 -1 -1   | 1 + -1 = 0            |
|               | 1 + 1 + -1 + -1 = 0   |
|               |                       |
| 0 0 0 0 0     | 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 |

_Hint: you may check for zero each of the 32 subsets with 32 `if` statements._
