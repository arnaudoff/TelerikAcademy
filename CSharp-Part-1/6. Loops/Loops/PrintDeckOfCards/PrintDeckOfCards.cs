/*
 * Write a program that generates and prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards (without the jokers). The cards should be printed using the 
 * classical notation (like 5 of spades, A of hearts, 9 of clubs; and K of diamonds).
 * The card faces should start from 2 to A.
 * Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. Use 2 nested for-loops and a switch-case statement.
