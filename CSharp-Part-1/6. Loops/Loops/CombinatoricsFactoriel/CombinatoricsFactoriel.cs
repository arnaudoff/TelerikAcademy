/*
 * In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k different members out of a group of n different elements (also known as the number of combinations) is calculated by the following formula: formula.
 * For example, there are 2598960 ways to withdraw 5 cards out of a standard deck of 52 cards.
 * Your task is to write a program that calculates n! / (k! * (n-k)!) for given n and k (1 < k < n < 100). Try to use only two loops.
