Homework: Loops
===============

### Problem 1.	Numbers from 1 to N
*	Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer `n` and prints all the numbers from `1` to `n`, on a single line, separated by a space.

_Examples:_

| n            | output    | 
|--------------|-----------|
| 3            | 1 2 3     | 
| 5            | 1 2 3 4 5 |

### Problem 2.	Numbers Not Divisible by 3 and 7
*	Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer `n` and prints all the numbers from `1` to `n` not divisible by `3` and `7`, on a single line, separated by a space.

_Examples:_

| n  | output       |
|----|--------------|
| 3  | 1 2          |
| 10 | 1 2 4 5 8 10 |

### Problem 3.	Min, Max, Sum and Average of N Numbers
*	Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of `n` integer numbers and returns the minimal, the maximal number, the sum and the average of all numbers (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point).
*	The input starts by the number `n` (alone in a line) followed by `n` lines, each holding an integer number.
*	The output is like in the examples below.

_Example 1:_

| input | output     |
|-------|------------|
| 3     | min = 1    |
| 2     | max = 5    |
| 5     | sum = 8    |
| 1     | avg = 2.67 |

_Example 2:_

| input | output     |
|-------|------------|
| 2     | min = -1   |
| -1    | max = 4    |
| 4     | sum = 3    |
|       | avg = 1.50 |


### Problem 4.	Print a Deck of 52 Cards
*	Write a program that generates and prints all possible cards from a [standard deck of 52 cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck) (without the jokers).
	The cards should be printed using the classical notation (like 5 of spades, A of hearts, 9 of clubs; and K of diamonds).
	*	The card faces should start from 2 to A.
	*	Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.
	Use 2 nested for-loops and a switch-case statement.
	
_output_

	2 of spades, 2 of clubs, 2 of hearts, 2 of diamonds
	3 of spades, 3 of clubs, 3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds
	…  
	K of spades, K of clubs, K of hearts, K of diamonds
	A of spades, A of clubs, A of hearts, A of diamonds

_Note: You may use the suit symbols instead of text._

### Problem 5.	Calculate 1 + 1!/X + 2!/X^2 + … + N!/X^N
*	Write a program that, for a given two integer numbers `n` and `x`, calculates the sum `S = 1 + 1!/x + 2!/x2 + … + n!/x^n`.
*	Use only one loop. Print the result with `5` digits after the decimal point.

_Examples:_

| n           | x          | S       |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| 3           | 2          | 2.75000 |
| 4           | 3          | 2.07407 |
| 5           | -4         | 0.75781 |

### Problem 6.	Calculate N! / K!

*	Use only one loop.

_Examples:_

| n           | k          | n! / k! |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| 5           | 2          | 60      |
| 6           | 5          | 6       |

### Problem 7.	Calculate N! / (K! * (N-K)!)
*	In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose `k` different members out of a group of `n` different elements (also known as the number of combinations) is calculated by the following formula:

For example, there are 2598960 ways to withdraw 5 cards out of a standard deck of 52 cards.
*	Your task is to write a program that calculates `n! / (k! * (n-k)!)` for given `n` and `k` (1 < k < n < 100). Try to use only two loops.

_Examples:_

| n           | k | n! / (k! * (n-k)!) |

| 4           | 2 | 6                  |
| 10          | 6 | 210                |
| 52          | 5 | 2598960            |

			1 2					1 2 3				1 2 3 4
			2 3					2 3 4				2 3 4 5
								3 4 5				3 4 5 6
													4 5 6 7

*	You are given `n` integers (given in a single line, separated by a space).
*	Write a program that checks whether the product of the odd elements is equal to the product of the even elements.
*	Elements are counted from `1` to `n`, so the first element is odd, the second is even, etc.

_Examples:_

|-------------------|--------|
| 2 1 1 6 3         | yes    |

|                   |        |
| 4 3 2 5 2         | no     |

_Note: The above output is just an example. Due to randomness, your program most probably will produce different results._

### Problem 12.* Randomize the Numbers 1…N
*	Write a program that enters in integer `n` and prints the numbers `1, 2, …, n` in random order.

_Examples:_
