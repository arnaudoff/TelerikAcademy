Homework: Introduction to Programming
========

### Problem 1.	Play with Visual Studio
*	Install Visual Studio on your laptop or home computer. Go to the official [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx) site and download the __Community 2013 with Update 4__ version.
*	Start Visual Studio and familiarize yourself with it. Create a simple C# program (console application), compile and run it.

You do not have to submit anything in your homework for this problem.

### Problem 2.	Blank Solution in Visual Studio
*	Create a blank solution in Visual Studio called `“Intro-Programming-Homework”`. This solution will hold all your homework projects, code and files. For each problem (exercises) add a separate project with self-descriptive name like `“Hello-World”` and `“Print-Your-Name”`.
	
	You do not have to submit anything in your homework for this problem.

### Problem 3.	Play with MSDN Library
*	Play with [Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library)  Library Documentation.
	*	Find information about Console.WriteLine() method in MSDN.
	*	Find information about the Console class.
	*	Find information about the class keyword.
	
You do not have to submit anything in your homework for this problem.

### Problem 4.	Hello World
*	Create, compile and run a `“Hello C#”` console application.
*	Ensure you have named the application well (e.g. “”HelloCSharp”).

You should submit the Visual Studio project holding the HelloCSharp class as part of your homework.

### Problem 5.	Print Your Name
*	Modify the previous application to print your name.
*	Ensure you have named the application well (e.g. “PrintMyName”).

You should submit a separate project Visual Studio project holding the PrintMyName class as part of your homework.

### Problem 6.	Print Numbers
*	Write a program to print the numbers `1, 101 and 1001`, each at a separate line.
*	Name the program correctly.

You should submit in your homework the Visual Studio project holding the source code of the PrintNumbers program.

### Problem 7.	Print First and Last Name
*	Create console application that prints your first and last name, each at a separate line.

### Problem 8.	Square Root
*	Create a console application that calculates and prints the square root of the number `12345`.
*	Find in Internet “how to calculate square root in C#”.

### Problem 9.	Print a Sequence
*	Write a program that prints the first 10 members of the sequence: `2, -3, 4, -5, 6, -7, ...`

### Problem 10.	Reformat C# Code
*	Reformat the following C# code to make it readable according to the C# best practices for code formatting. Change the casing of the identifiers in the code (e.g. use PascalCase for the class name):
HorribleCode.cs

```c#
using

System;

class hoRRiblEcoDe
{
	static
	 void

		Main()
	{
		Console.

	WriteLine("Hi, I am horribly formatted program"
); Console.
	  WriteLine("Numbers and squares:")
; for (int i = 0;
i < 10;
i++)
		{
			Console.WriteLine(i +
				" --> " + i
				*
				i);
		}
	}
}
```

### Problem 11.	Programming Languages
*	Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages. How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?
*	Write in a text file called `“programming-languages.txt”` at least five languages along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

### Problem 12.	Development Environments
*	Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with popular development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.
*	Write in a text file called `“list-of-IDEs.txt”` at least five IDEs along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

### Problem 13.	C# and .NET Differences
*	Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework in 2-3 sentences.
*	Write your description in a text file called `“csharp-and-dot-net-framework.txt”`. Use English.

### Problem 14.*	Current Date and Time
*	Create a console application that prints the current date and time. Find out how in Internet.

### Problem 15.*	Age after 10 Years
*	Write a program to read your birthday from the console and print how old you are now and how old you will be after 10 years.

### Problem 16.*	Print Long Sequence
*	Write a program that prints the first 1000 members of the sequence: `2, -3, 4, -5, 6, -7, …`
*	You might need to learn how to use loops in C# (search in Internet).

### Problem 17.*	Play with the Debugger in Visual Studio
*	Write a program that prints at the console the numbers from `1 to 1000`, each at a separate line.
*	You might need to learn how to use loops (search in Internet).
*	Set a breakpoint in the line, which prints the next number in the Visual Studio code editor. Run the program through the debugger using the `[F5]` key. When the debugger stops at the breakpoint trace the code execution with `[F10]` key.

You do not have to submit anything in your homework for this problem. Just play with the debugger to learn how it works.
