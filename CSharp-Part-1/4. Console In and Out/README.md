*	Write a program that reads 3 numbers:
	*	integer `a` (0 <= a <= 500)
	*	floating-point `b`
	*	floating-point `c` 
*	The program then prints them in 4 virtual columns on the console. Each column should have a width of 10 characters.	
	*	The number `a` should be printed in hexadecimal, left aligned
	*	Then the number `a` should be printed in binary form, padded with zeroes
	*	The number `b` should be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point, right aligned
	*	The number c should be printed with 3 digits after the decimal point, left aligned.

### Problem 12.** Falling Rocks
*	Implement the "Falling Rocks" game in the text console.
	*	A small dwarf stays at the bottom of the screen and can move left and right (by the arrows keys).	
	*	A number of rocks of different sizes and forms constantly fall down and you need to avoid a crash.	
	*	Rocks are the symbols `^, @, *, &, +, %, $, #, !, ., ;, -` distributed with appropriate density. The dwarf is `(O)`.
*	Ensure a constant game speed by `Thread.Sleep(150)`.
*	Implement collision detection and scoring system.
