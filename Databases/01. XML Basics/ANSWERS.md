### What does the XML language represent? What is it used for?

XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language. It was designed to store and transport structured data (usually representing hierarchical [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) structure), while being both human- and machine-readable.

### What do namespaces represent in an XML document? What are they used for?

XML namespaces are used for providing uniquely named elements and attributes in an XML document. Basically, instead of renaming tags so there's no conflict between them, we separate them into two namespaces. So the XML namespaces pretty much share the same idea as the C++ or C# namespaces.
