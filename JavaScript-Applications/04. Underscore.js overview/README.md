## Task 1

Create a function that:
*   Takes an array of students
    *   Each student has a `firstName` and `lastName` properties
*   **Finds** all students whose `firstName` is before their `lastName` alphabetically
*   Then **sorts** them in descending order by fullname
    *   fullname is the concatenation of `firstName`, ' ' (empty space) and `lastName`
*   Then **prints** the fullname of founded students to the console
*   **Use underscore.js for all operations**

## Task 2

Create a function that:
*   Takes an array of students
    *   Each student has a `firstName`, `lastName` and `age` properties
*   **finds** the students whose age is between 18 and 24
*   **prints**  the fullname of found students, sorted lexicographically ascending
    *   fullname is the concatenation of `firstName`, ' ' (empty space) and `lastName`
*   **Use underscore.js for all operations**

## Task 3

Create a function that:
*   Takes an array of students
    *   Each student has:
        *   `firstName`, `lastName` and `age` properties
        *   Array of decimal numbers representing the marks
*   **finds** the student with highest average mark (there will be only one)
*   **prints** to the console  'FOUND_STUDENT_FULLNAME has an average score of MARK_OF_THE_STUDENT'
    *   fullname is the concatenation of `firstName`, ' ' (empty space) and `lastName`
*   **Use underscore.js for all operations**

## Task 4

Create a function that:
*   **Takes** an array of animals
    *   Each animal has propeties `name`, `species` and `legsCount`
*   **groups** the animals by `species`
    *   the groups are sorted by `species` descending
*   **sorts** them ascending by `legsCount`
	*	if two animals have the same number of legs sort them by name
*   **prints** them to the console in the format:

```
    ----------- (number of dashes is equal to the length of the GROUP_1_NAME + 1)
    GROUP_1_NAME:
    ----------- (number of dashes is equal to the length of the GROUP_1_NAME + 1)
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the first animal in group 1
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the second animal in group 1
    ----------- (number of dashes is equal to the length of the GROUP_2_NAME + 1)
    GROUP_2_NAME:
    ----------- (number of dashes is equal to the length of the GROUP_2_NAME + 1)
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the first animal in the group 2
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the second animal in the group 2
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the third animal in the group 2
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the fourth animal in the group 2
```
*   **Use underscore.js for all operations**

## Task 5

Create a function that:
*   **Takes** an array of animals
    *   Each animal has propeties `name`, `species` and `legsCount`
*   **finds** and **prints** the total number of legs to the console in the format:
    *   "Total number of legs: TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_LEGS"
*   **Use underscore.js for all operations**

## Task 6

Create a function that:
*   **Takes** a collection of books
    *   Each book has propeties `title` and `author`
        **  `author` is an object that has properties `firstName` and `lastName`
*   **finds** the most popular author (the author with biggest number of books)
*   **prints** the author to the console
	*	if there is more than one author print them all sorted in ascending order by fullname
		*   fullname is the concatenation of `firstName`, ' ' (empty space) and `lastName`
*   **Use underscore.js for all operations**
